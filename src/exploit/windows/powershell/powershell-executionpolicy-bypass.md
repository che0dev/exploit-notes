## Method 1. Set-ExecutionPolicy

By default, the ExecutionPolicy is set to `Restricted`.

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy
# Restricted
```

To bypass the restriction, run one of the following commands as **Administrator** privilege:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

<br />

## Method 2. Run with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

```bash
powershell -noexit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File example.ps1
```
